00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:15.480
In this course Evaluating Designs with Users we will be diving into user testing.

2
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.230
User Testing is one of the key, if not the key, methods in UX research, and

3
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.560
knowing how to conduct a user test is absolutely essential for

4
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.580
anyone working in UX regardless of their role.

5
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.980
So what is User Testing?

6
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.460
Well, basically what it means is you&amp;#39;re gonna watch,

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.290
representative users, that is, the types of people that you expect to use a system.

8
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.665
Try to accomplish important tasks using that product.

9
00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:46.686
And so, that&amp;#39;s pretty much all it is, you&amp;#39;re gonna just bring people in, or

10
00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.680
you&amp;#39;re gonna go to where they are, and have them do a few things,

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.610
and you&amp;#39;re just gonna watch what happens.

12
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.280
So, why do we do User Testing?

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.520
What do you get out of it?

14
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.230
Well, in a nutshell, you learn a lot from watching people use this system.

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.490
You learn what works, and what doesn&amp;#39;t, where do they run into trouble.

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.980
Where does the system support what they are trying to do, and where does it not.

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.200
You also learn why things work and they don&amp;#39;t.

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.560
You really can see, when you watch people struggle with a system,

19
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.610
you can see what might be broken, or what might be causing the problem that gives

20
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.580
you some clues about what it is you need to fix.

21
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.440
You also often learn about user needs that you missed,

22
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.470
that maybe you didn&amp;#39;t get right earlier in the process when you were trying to

23
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.330
understand what users&amp;#39; needs are.

24
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.780
You put something in front of people and

25
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270
say, hey is this the thing that you needed?

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.540
And they say, no, I forgot to tell you I actually need it done this way.

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.060
And so you can learn a lot that will help you design a better version

28
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.570
of the product.

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.310
Well why not just use your own experience?

30
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.110
Why not just try these things out yourself and see where it works and

31
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.070
where it doesn&amp;#39;t work?

32
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.730
Well, there&amp;#39;s a couple of reasons why your own experience

33
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.940
isn&amp;#39;t necessarily gonna be enough.

34
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.050
For one thing, you often know too much, especially if this is a system that

35
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.760
you&amp;#39;re helping to build, or a system that you&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time with.

36
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.850
You&amp;#39;ve already figured out how to do all the things you need to do.

37
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.150
You may know the workarounds to get things done,

38
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.960
that new people aren&amp;#39;t gonna necessarily be aware of.

39
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.620
And so it might be easier for you to use the system than it&amp;#39;s going to be for

40
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.260
other people.

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.140
And you need to see how other people are approaching it.

42
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.980
In some cases, you also might know too little,

43
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.200
you don&amp;#39;t really know enough about the users, and what their expectations are.

44
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.170
And what their mental models are, and how they think a task should work.

45
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.826
Until you seem them try it out,

46
00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:36.472
until you see them go through the process of working through a task.

47
00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:40.484
So, your own experience is valuable, your own intuition is valuable about what

48
00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:43.340
works and what doesn&amp;#39;t, but it&amp;#39;s often not enough.

49
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.350
And that&amp;#39;s why we do user testing to see how other people come at and

50
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.070
interact with products that we&amp;#39;re interested in understanding.

51
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.840
So the basic idea behind User Testing is you&amp;#39;re gonna go,

52
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.330
and you&amp;#39;re gonna find potential users,

53
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.630
people that are the types of people that you expect to use your system.

54
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.890
You&amp;#39;re gonna ask them to do some stuff and we&amp;#39;re gonna call those tasks.

55
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.900
You&amp;#39;re gonna observe what happens, you&amp;#39;re gonna ask them some questions afterwards,

56
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.940
about their experience.

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.010
And then you&amp;#39;re gonna write down what you learned, and

58
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.600
figure out what that tells you about how the system ought to be improved.

59
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.510
In the rest of this course, we will go deeper into each aspect of the User Test,

60
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.900
looking at how to design, prepare for, conduct, and

61
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.810
analyze user tests as part of UX research.
