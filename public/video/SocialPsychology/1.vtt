1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.511
How much of the meaning that we communicate comes from the words we say compared to the

2
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:13.100
other things, the nonverbal things?

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.740
This is a difficult question to answer.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.840
Some people think that the answer is about 93% - with 53% of the information coming from

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.259
the face, another 38% from the voice, and only 7% from the words themselves.

6
00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.789
This is quite a common belief.

7
00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.350
Mehrabian’s (1972) work has been criticised though for the way the studies were conducted;

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.329
they were pretty artificial and didn’t recreate how we really communicate.

9
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.910
Michael Argyle (1988) tried to improve on those studies and suggested that nonverbal

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.350
communication was 4.3 times as powerful as verbal communication - so that’s still around

11
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.350
81%.

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.890
Hsee and his colleagues suggested that nonverbal communication was also about 4 times as powerful,

13
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.340
or about 80% of the message (Hsee, Hatfield &amp; Chemtob, 1992).

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.580
Part of the reason why these numbers might be so high is because participants are guessing

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.950
what the experimenter wants them to do.

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.420
Trimboli and Walker (1987) showed that when you hide the true purpose of the study from

17
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.360
participants, the overwhelming effect of nonverbal communication goes away.

18
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.509
Our best guess, according to authors such as Burgoon, Guerrero and Floyd (2016), is

19
00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.010
about sixty to sixty-six percent of meaning is communicated through things other than

20
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.349
words.

21
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.100
  That number is going to go up or down depending

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.630
on the context.

23
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.280
If you&#39;re trying to make an assessment of someone&#39;s leadership ability, for example,

24
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.569
whether someone has integrity, you tend to focus on the nonverbal, even if you&#39;re not

25
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.299
really aware of doing it, and that&#39;s for a good reason.

26
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.520
If you hear a politician speak on an election campaign, you know that their words have been

27
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.880
carefully scripted.

28
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.280
The words have been carefully crafted.

29
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.509
After a while, we start to look beyond those words, and we start to look at things that

30
00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.429
we presume they can&#39;t control so well.

31
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.109
We look at whether their eye contact looks meaningful.

32
00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.249
We look at the way they hold the baby.

33
00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.600
We look at whether they sweat—all these little subtle cues of whether someone&#39;s got

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740
integrity, they can be trusted, and we rely on them.

35
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.040
When the verbal and nonverbal channels are in conflict, the role or importance of nonverbals

36
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.250
often tends to go up.

37
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.520
  Person 1: “Are you mad about something?”

38
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.550
Person 2: “No!

39
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.580
I’m perfectly happy!”

40
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.209
Person 1: “Ok, just asking.”

41
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.409
Blake: The interaction that you just watched perfectly illustrates the point I&#39;m making

42
00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.409
here.

43
00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.939
Here, the second person’s verbal and nonverbal channels are totally in conflict.

44
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.670
Verbally, she&#39;s saying she&#39;s not angry.

45
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.010
Nonverbally, she&#39;s suggesting that maybe she is, but there&#39;s no doubt in your mind which

46
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.280
one you trust at this point.

47
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.299
You know that she&#39;s angry.

48
00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.120
Again, we have this sense that people lie through their words.

49
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.599
After a while, we look beyond the words.

50
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.189
We focus on things that we feel as though people are not as good at lying through, that

51
00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.599
the real juicy stuff is found in the nonverbals.

52
00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.750
It&#39;s also probably true for humans that we sometimes let our nonverbals do the talking

53
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.420
for us because we live in a fairly non-assertive, polite world.

54
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.569
You probably go through life without ever saying certain things that you&#39;re thinking.

55
00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.110
You can go through life without ever saying, &quot;Look, you&#39;re kind of boring me now.

56
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.989
I want to talk to someone else,&quot; or &quot;You smell&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t love you anymore.&quot;

57
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.379
You might think these things but you might try not say it.

58
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.450
What you might do is you say nothing, but you kind of beam out these vibes through your

59
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.659
nonverbals, and you hope that people get it.

60
00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.599
That&#39;s how a lot of communication happens.

61
00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.549
Now, it could well be that the person in the interaction you just watched wanted the other

62
00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.260
person to notice that she was angry, but for whatever reason she just didn&#39;t feel like

63
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.030
she could say it.

64
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.829
If you ask somebody out on a date and they say, &quot;Yes, yes, that sounds good,&quot; but they

65
00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.450
sound disinterested, you&#39;re probably going to weigh that fairly heavily in working out

66
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.940
whether that person is really into you or not.

67
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.629
Or at least you probably should.

68
00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.520
Young children place slightly more reliance on words (Liebal, Carpenter &amp; Tomasello, 2011).

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.920
Babies start off pretty hopeless, right?

70
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.519
If you&#39;ve ever seen babies, they just don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.

71
00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.870
They don&#39;t even know that these hands flying all over their face are their hands.

72
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.220
They have no idea.

73
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.079
Then within two years, they&#39;ve got this precocious semi-mastery of language.

74
00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.940
Their capacity to absorb language is phenomenal.

75
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.910
It takes a little bit longer to be able to understand the subtleties of their language.

76
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.470
That&#39;s something that adults tend to be good at.

77
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.430
The fact that children are a bit more literal—they focus on the words—can cause problems when

78
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.610
adults are talking to them, because quite often we purposely bend the meaning of what

79
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.710
we&#39;re saying through our nonverbals or through our tone.

80
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.510
If you think about sarcasm—what is sarcasm, when you actually break it down?

81
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.319
Sarcasm is where you say something positive through the verbal channel, but through the

82
00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.300
nonverbal channel—through the tone—you indicate that you actually mean something

83
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.699
negative.

84
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.380
Usually adults are pretty good at picking up on sarcasm, so long as you&#39;re not trying

85
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.970
to do it over email or anything.

86
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.289
Interpersonally, we&#39;re pretty good, but kids, less so.

87
00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.070
The opposite of this is good-natured teasing.

88
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.849
You say something negative through the verbal channel, but you actually indicate, through

89
00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.310
the nonverbal channel, that you&#39;re actually very affectionate towards that person.

90
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.930
It&#39;s a hard one to pull off.

91
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.190
You don&#39;t want to mess it up.

92
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.700
In some cultures, nicknames become more and more offensive and cruel when people like

93
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.430
each other the most.

94
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.960
Also, we rely on verbal and nonverbal channels differently depending on what we&#39;re trying

95
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.169
to get out of a situation.

96
00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.840
In this context, where I am talking to you about academic content, you might be dimly

97
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.160
aware of me waving my hands around, but you&#39;re probably not going to focus on that, that

98
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.430
much.

99
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.990
What you&#39;re really here for is facts, and words are the best things to communicate facts.

100
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.930
But Riggio (1992) makes the point that in a social context, we focus more on the nonverbal.

101
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.560
If what you really want to know is, &quot;Does this person like me?&quot; or &quot;Is this person bored?&quot;

102
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.380
in this context, you&#39;re probably going to focus a lot more on the nonverbals.
